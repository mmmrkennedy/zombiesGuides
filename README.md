# mmmrkennedy's Zombies Easter Egg Guides

https://zombies-guides.vercel.app/
(Switched to Vercel from Github Pages because github wouldn't let me upload the full site.)

The goal of this site is to archive and compile accurate and up-to-date information on all COD: Zombies Easter Egg.
The guides don't contain video tutorials (as of right now), but rather text and images.

The plan is to also include solvers for steps that require them (such as IW's Attack of the Radioactive Thing's Chemicals and BO3's Gorod Krovi's Valves.)

Note: I have very limited HTML and CSS knowledge, so the site may look a bit rough around the edges. I'm basically teaching my self as I go along.
