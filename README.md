# mmmrkennedy's Zombies Easter Egg Guides

https://mmmrkennedy.github.io/zombiesGuides/


The goal of this site is to archive and compile accurate and up-to-date information on all COD: Zombies Easter Egg.
The guides don't contain video tutorials (as of right now), but rather text and image based guides.

The plan is to also include solvers for steps that require them (such as IW's Attack of the Radioactive Thing's Chemical Step and BO3's Gorod Krovi's Valves.)

Note: I have very limited HTML and CSS knowledge, so the site may look a bit rough around the edges. I'm basically teaching my self as I go along.
