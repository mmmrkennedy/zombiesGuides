    <h3>RAI K-84</h3>
    <p>The RAI K-84 is available through the mystery box, completion of challenges, and via the following quest: <br>The KAI K-84 can simply be Pack-A-Punched and does not require an Easter Egg to do so.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to Weapon Lab and pick up <a href="pictures/raik/raik_blueprint.jpg" target="_blank">the RAI K-84 Blueprint</a></li>
      <li>Go to the Scorched Defense and interact with <a href="pictures/raik/raik_tankbody.jpg" target="_blank">the body by the tank</a> to get the eye.</li>
      <li>Go back to the Weapon Lab and interact with <a href="pictures/raik/raik_scanner.jpg" target="_blank">the Retina Scanner</a> to open the drawer. Pick up the key from the drawer.</li>
      <li>Go to Barracks 1 and 2 and open the lockers. When you open a locker, a mimic might spawn if it does kill it and check if it dropped the Barrel Assembly</li>
      <li>Wait for a Mangler to spawn. Kill it and see if it dropped the Charged Power Cell, if it didn't, you have to wait for another one to spawn.</li>
      <li>Once you have the Charged Power Cell, return to the Weapon Lab and interact with <a href="pictures/raik/raik_powercell.jpg" target="_blank">this computer</a> to charge the cell. Wait a full round then comeback and pick it up.</li>
      <li>Go to the Weapon Lab and interact with the computer. It will display a graphic which is divided into several triangles, this <a href="pictures/raik/raik_dartboard_ref.jpg" target="_blank">represents a dart board.</a> The lit triangle will start moving, take note of where it stops as these are the numbers you will need.</li>
      <li>Go to the Village, to the room with the wunderfizz. Just to the left of the wunderfizz is <a href="pictures/raik/raik_dartboard.png" target="_blank">a dart board</a>. You must shoot the 3 numbers (the actual numbers on the board not the part you would hit if you were actually playing darts) then shoot the bullseye. <br>The dart board will open and the part will fly onto the ground.</li>
      <li>Go back to the Weapon Lab and craft the RAI-K 84 where you picked up the blueprint.</li>

  <!-- Main Easter Egg -->
  <div class="content-container" id="main_ee">
    <h3>Main Easter Egg</h3>
    <p><i><b>Stats (Solo): Difficulty - 4/10, Est Completion Time - 40 Mins to 1 Hr, RNG Rating - 0/5</b></i></p>
    <ol class="step-content">
      <p>Note: The <a href="#raik84">RAI K-84</a> is required for the easter egg, but you do not need it until step 15</p>
      <li>Open Pack-a-punch</a></li>
      <li>In the Atrium (Pack-a-Punch room), speak to Ravenov, then go to Mission Control and speak to Dr. Peck, then go back to the atrium and speak to Ravenov again. He will give you his ID Badge. </li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Creating the Serum:</p>
      <li>Once you pick up the ID Badge, open three lockers and collect the compounds in each</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Compound S16: <a href="pictures/quest/quest_chem_spawn.png" target="_blank">Equipment Storage: </a>looking at Quick Revive, the room on the right</li>
        <li>Compound 36: <a href="pictures/quest/quest_chem_eng.png" target="_blank">Engineering: </a>from the teleporter from spawn, the area on the left</li>
        <li>Compound P65: <a href="pictures/quest/quest_chem_office.png" target="_blank">Colonel's Office: </a>the office above jug</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Go to Field Hospital and interact with the <a href="pictures/quest/quest_chem_mixer.png" target="_blank">Chemical Mixer</a>. This will spawn some hellhounds, kill them, interact with the Chemical Mixer again and pick up the Agent Delivery System beside the Chemical Mixer.</li>
      <li>Go to the OPC, and interact with the <a href="pictures/quest/quest_chem_acunit.png" target="_blank">air conditioner unit</a> to place the Agent Delivery System. This will fill Peck's room with gas.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Collect Mimic's Memories: </p>
      <li>Keep interacting with Peck until Weaver says "Alright, Peck. You've had your fun..."</li>
      <li>Go to the Data Center and interact with the <a href="pictures/quest/quest_mimic_trapstation.png" target="_blank">Memory Transference Station</a>. Pick up one of the Essence Traps.</li>
      <li>In the locations below, there will be a mimic hiding as loot. Damage the mimic until it has about 10% health remaining then throw the essence trap on the ground. Once the mimic is standing on the trap, double tap the interact button to activate the trap. <br>Only one Mimic will spawn at one of the three locations once per round. If you accidentally kill a mimic, leave that area, end the round and comeback next round, it might have spawned back. <br>If it didn't spawn back check one of the other locations or leave the area and end the round again.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="pictures/quest/quest_mimic_motorpool.png" target="_blank">Motor Pool: </a>from the teleporter from spawn, the area on the right</li>

      </ul>
      <li>Once you collect a mimic, you have 3 minutes to return to the machine you picked up the trap from and deposit the mimic. <br>If you collect the right mimic, either <b>Brahms, Sokolov or Zhabin</b> will start speaking.</li>
      <li>Once you've heard from Brahms, Sokolov and Zhabin, interact with the machine to pick up a floppy disk.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Stabilize the Breach: </p>
      <li>Go to the Planning Office (Room above the Engineering locker from Step 3) and insert the floppy disk in to <a href="pictures/quest/quest_mimic_floppyinsert.png" target="_blank">this computer</a>. This will open the door to the OPC. Enter it to spawn a dimensional breach. <br>When the PA system says "Attention: membrane instability detected. Stabilization Required." Talk to Dr. Peck.</li>
      <li>After Dr. Peck is finished talking, Ravenov will give you a code, interact with the locker beside Peck's window to open it. Pick up the Aethermeter from the locker.</li>
      <li>Go to Scorched Defence and pick up the shovel from the bunker on the left.</li>
      <li>You must now dig up 3 Aether Crystals located in the locations below. Each crystal has a small "minigame" associated with it.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="pictures/quest/quest_container_lot.png" target="_blank">Open Lot: </a>from the teleporter from spawn, the area on the left</li>

      </ul>
      <li>Open Lot: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Dig up the Container near the window to Engineering. Interact with the container to start the minigame.</li>
        <li>When you interact with the container, it will disappear and several containers will spawn around the area.</li>
        <li>You must find and interact with the <a href="pictures/quest/quest_container_noblack.jpg" target="_blank">container with no black particles</a></li>
        <li>All the other containers in the area contain <a href="pictures/quest/quest_container_black.jpg" target="_blank">black particles</a></li>
        <li>If you interact with an incorrect container, kill the mimics that spawn and end the round to respawn the containers to try again.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Jungle Defence: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Dig up the Container in the <a href="pictures/quest/quest_container_jungle.png" target="_blank">middle lane</a> where zombies spawn during the defence.</li>
        <li>A dome will spawn. Simply survive inside the dome until it disappears, and you are able to pick up the container.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Barracks: </li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The <a href="#raik84">RAI K-84</a> is required for this step</b></li>
        <li>Dig up the Container near the <a href="pictures/quest/quest_container_hospital.png" target="_blank">right door of the Field Hospital</a> near the stairs to the Data Center.</li>
        <li>The Container will then teleport to a random location in and around the Barracks and Field Hospital.</li>
        <li>Once you locate the Container, don't go near it, instead shoot it with the RAI-K 84's Alternate Fire Mode (The Orb). Quickly, while the Container is in the Orb's AOE, pick it up.</li>
        <li>If you fail to pick up the Container quickly enough or go too close, it will teleport to a new locator where you can repeat the above.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Once you collect all three Containers, place them in each of the Aether Reactors around the base. Locations Below</li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="pictures/quest/quest_container_militarycommand.png" target="_blank">Military Command</a></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="step-group-title">Warning: Point of No Return. Once you do the next step, you will be put into the Boss Fight</p>
      <li>Go to the Planning Office and interact with <a href="pictures/quest/quest_sat.png" target="_blank">this computer</a>. Move the marker to the yellow dot that shows a question mark instead of either the US or USSR flag. Press interact to confirm alignment.</li>
      <li>Return to the OPC and interact with the Terminal to begin a cutscene.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Orda Boss Fight: </p>
      <li>You will be teleported to spawn where you must fight Orda.</li>
      <li>Simply, shoot Orda till it's health bar hits 0. Orda's mouth is a critical damage point when its orange.</li>
      <li>Avoid getting near Orda as it has an attack where it slams its arm on the ground which can one shot you.</li>
      <li>You still have access to Pack-a-Punch, Wunderfizz, Workbench and the Armory making this boss fight very easy.</li>
