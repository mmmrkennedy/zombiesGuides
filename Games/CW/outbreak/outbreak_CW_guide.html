            <h4 class="step-set-title">Obtain the Beacon Listening Device</h4>
            <li>Reach Round 3 (Tip: After selecting Warp at the Beacon on Round 1, you can Shoot/Melee the beacon to skip Round 2 and go straight to Round 3)</a></li>
            <li>You must find a radio (the locations below) and interact with it. When you interact with it will start playing Feedback, and a bunch of zombies and mini-bosses will start spawning near you. Once you kill them, the subtitles will show a number.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Alpine</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Duga</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Golova</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Ruka</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Sanatorium</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Zoo</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Collateral</a></li>
            </ul>
            <li>You must then find three Amplifies located around the radio and set them to the same number as the main radio:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Alpine</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Duga</a></li>

                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Collateral</a></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once the three Amplifiers are set to the correct number, go back to the main radio and interact with it. It will drop a Beacon Listening Device.</li>
            <li>Go to the Beacon and select the "Respond" option. If you don't want to listen to the dialogue, you can warp as soon as the beacon will let you interact with it again. Otherwise, warp to the next area when ever you'd like.</li>

            <h4 class="step-set-title">Obtain the Microfilm</h4>
            <li>In the new region, there are 4 Stone Monkey Bomb Statues (Locations Below) you must find the one with an "M" drawn on a wall near it. When you find the Statue with the "M", you must shoot it, and it will drop "Microfilm Reels."</li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Alpine</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Duga</a></li>

                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Collateral</a></li>
            </ul>
            <li>After Picking up the "Microfilm Reel", you must take it to a projector (locations below) and interact with it three times. Each time a dialogue will play, and you must wait for it to finish before interacting with it again. Once the third dialogue starts, you can Warp using the Beacon.<br><b>Note: If you are on Ruka for this step, you will have to Warp to a new Region, complete the objective then be Warp again to get back to Ruka. Otherwise, you will always be teleported to Ruka after interacting with the projector.</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Alpine</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Duga</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Golova</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Ruka</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Sanatorium</a></li>

                <li><a href="pictures" target="_blank">Collateral</a></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once you spawn in Ruka, follow the mission objective to enter the Missile Silos. Once inside, navigate to the bottom floor of Silo A and locate the computer terminal labelled "Lift the Lockdown." Interact with it to start the cutscene.</li>

            <h4 class="step-set-title">Finding and using the Launch Keys</h4>
            <li>You must now find three launch keys. They are each tied to a series of steps and are located in Silo A, B and C respectively.</li>
            <li>Silo A: Monkey & Essence Trap</li>
            <ul>
                <li>On the bottom floor of Missile Silo A is <a href="pictures" target="_blank">a dead-end tunnel</a> which contains an Essence Trap, collect it to replace your Tactical Equipment slot. (It is the same as the traps found in the Firebase Z Easter Egg)</li>
                <li>There will be an <a href="pictures" target="_blank">Aether Monkey in one of the vents</a> along the walls of Silo A. You must slowly approach the vent the Monkey is in until it vanishes.</li>
                <li>Once it's gone, throw the Trap near the vent and then run away from the trap. Once you are far enough, the Monkey will teleport onto the trap, activate it to attempt to capture the Monkey.</li>
                <li>The Monkey will escape, but it will leave a key on the trap, interact with it to pick up the key.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Silo B: Aetherium Canister & Jellyfish</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures" target="_blank">Aetherium Harvesting Unit</a> on the bottom floor of Missile Silo B.</li>
                <li>Next, locate and shoot the <a href="pictures" target="_blank">Aetherium Crystals</a> which line the walls of the silo to drop Aetherium Crystal Chunks.</li>
                <li>Once 20 chunks have been collected (shared inventory among all players), return to and interact with the Aetherium Harvesting Unit to deposit the Aetherium Crystal Chunks.</li>
                <li>Upon depositing all the required chunks, a wave of enemies will spawn. Eliminate these enemies, then interact with the harvesting unit to collect the Aetherium canister and replace your Field Upgrade.</li>
                <li>Navigate to Missile Silo D and locate the <a href="pictures" target="_blank">large Aether jellyfish</a>. While standing on <a href="pictures" target="_blank">the staircase closest to the jellyfish</a>, activate the Aetherium Field Upgrade to enter the jellyfish.</li>
                <li>While within the jellyfish, you are able to collect one of the launch keys.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Silo C: Mimics</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Main Hub area connecting the silos, a bunch of mimics will spawn disguised as various items like TVs and Plants.</li>
                <li>After killing the Mimics, interact with the corpse that can be found within <a href="pictures" target="_blank">the corridor leading to Silo C</a>.</li>
                <li>Interacting with the corpse will spawn Ruzarkon the Twisted. Defeat this HVT Mimic to collect one of the Launch Keys.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Warning: Point of No Return. Once you activate the three missiles, you will be put into the Boss Fight</h4>
            <li>Once all keys have been collected, you must activate all missiles in order within a time limit. Each missile can be activated using a <a href="pictures" target="_blank">control panel</a> in the corresponding silo. If you activate them in the wrong order or run out of time, you can simply try again immediately.</li>
            <li>To find the correct order, you must look at <a href="pictures" target="_blank">the three lights below the keyhole</a> on each control panel. The position of the green light will tell you where the silo is in the activation order. <br>For Example, If Silo B's Light is green in the third position and Silo A's Light is green in the second position, the activation order will be <b>D, A, B</b></li>

            <h4 class="step-set-title">Boss Fight</h4>
            <li>Once you activate all three panels, a nine-minute countdown will start. You will have to complete the Boss Fight in this amount of time. Go to the hub room (where all the mimics spawned) and run up the stairs to outside to start the boss fight.</li>
            <li></li>
