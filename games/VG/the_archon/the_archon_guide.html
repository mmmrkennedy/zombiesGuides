            <li>Build Pack-a-Punch</li>
            <li>Place the relic on the <a href="pictures/main_ee/stone_mirror.png">stone</a> in front of Pack-a-Punch to start a cutscene.</li>
            <li>Once the cutscene is finished, interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/portal_darkaether.png">portal near the relic</a> to teleport to the Dark Aether.</li>
            <li>After surviving in the Dark Aether for a few minutes, all players will be downed and returned to the Eastern Desert.</li>
            <li>The player must now complete three trials, Trial of Mindfulness, Trial of Resilience and Trial of Sacrifice. These trials can be completed at anytime in any order.</li>
            <li>Obtain a Shovel from one of the following locations: </li>

                </ul>

            <p class="step-group-title">Trial of Mindfulness</p>
            <li>Dig around <a href="pictures/main_ee/mindfulness_obelisk.png">Obelisk</a> in Merchant Road to find a <a href="pictures/main_ee/mindfulness_redorb.png">red orb</a>.</li>
            <li>Interact with the Red Orb to make it show <a href="pictures/main_ee/midfulness_symbol.png">symbols</a>. The player must stand on the runes on the ground matching the symbols on the wall in the same order as the symbols that appeared on the wall. <b>Bug: If the player is not able to interact with the orb to start the symbols, they have to go down and get revived to allow them to interact with the orb.</b></li>
            <li>If done correctly, the player will be required to survive until a timer hits zero without failing a challenge.</li>
            <li>If the player successfully completes the challenge, they will have to complete two more rounds of matching symbols and surviving.</li>
            <li>The first round consists of three symbols, the second round consists of four symbols and the last is five symbols.</li>
            <li>Once all three rounds are complete, the player must interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/mindfulness_obelisk.png">Obelisk</a> to start the Trial of Mindfulness.</li>
            <li>The player must capture runes without killing zombies. If failed, the Trial can be attempted next round.</li>
            <li>Once completed, the player will be given a bonus points and full armour drop.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title" id="trial_of_resilience">Trial of Resilience</p>
            <li>Navigate to the Debris Field and shoot one of the three Dark Aether Crystals outside the playable area until one spawns an orb: </li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/resilience_crystal1.png">Crystal 1</a></li>

            </ul>
            <li>Once the three Crystals have been destroyed, a <a href="pictures/main_ee/resilience_redorb.png">red orb</a> will spawn near the Decimator Shield.</li>
            <li>The player must locate and return three cursed items back to the orb. When these items are picked up, sprint will be disabled and the player will be given a challenge. Simply return the items to the orb without failing the challenge. The locations are: </li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/resilience_cursedhat.png">Cursed Officer's Hat, located in the Tents</a>.</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Once all items are returned, the Decimator Shield will become available for pickup.</li>
            <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/resilience_obelisk.png">Obelisk</a> to start the Trial Of Resilience.</li>
            <li>The player must destroy <a href="pictures/main_ee/resilience_syphoncore.png">Syphoncores</a> using the Decimator Shield's special ability (Slam) and deliver Demon Blood to the <a href="pictures/main_ee/resilience_emptyfountain.png">empty Demonic Fountain</a>.</li>
            <li>There are three Syphoncores that need to be destroyed: </li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/syphoncore_shield.png">Near the Decimator Shield</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/syphoncore_quick.png">Near Venomous Vigor (Quick Revive)</a></li>

            </ul>
            <li>Once the empty Demonic Fountain is filled, the player will be given bonus points, full armour, max ammo and full power drops.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title">Trial of Sacrifice</p>
            <li>Obtain three Molotov Cocktails either from the <a href="pictures/main_ee/molotovwallbuy.png">wallbuy in Merchant Road West</a> or from one of the Workbenchs.</li>
            <li>Navigate to Derailment and using the Molotovs light three torches as fast as possible: </li>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_torch1.png">Boxcar leading to Derailment</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_torch2.png">Right side of Derailment</a></li>
                <li><a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_torch3.png">Behind the second torch</a></li>
            </ul>
            <li>If the torches are lit at the same time, a <a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_redorb.png">red orb</a> will spawn near the third torch.</li>
            <li>The orb will request the player to sacrifice a Pack-a-Punched weapon (there is no way to get this weapon back). The cheapest option is to find a blue (PAP level 1) wallbuy and sacrifice that as it is cheaper than upgrading using the PAP Machine.</li>
            <li>After sacrificing the weapon, you will lose your entire armour and an Uberkrieger will spawn.</li>
            <li>Once killed, the orb will move to the <a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_obelisk.png">Obelisk</a>, which can be interacted with.</li>
            <li>To complete the trial, you will need the Ring of Fire Field Upgrade. There is a <a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_tablet.png">stone next to where the orb was</a> that will allow you to change your field upgrade into Ring of Fire.</li>
            <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_obelisk.png">Obelisk</a> to start the Trial of Sacrifice.</li>
            <li>At any time during the trail, the player can kill five zombies near the Obelisk to spawn a Full Power.</li>
            <li>Several other Obelisks will spawn around the area. The player must get six kills near each of the Obelisks while standing in the Ring of Fire.</li>
            <li>Once an obelisk is charged, a <a href="pictures/main_ee/sacrifice_beamoflight.png">beam of light</a> will connect it to the central obelisk.</li>
            <li>Once all the obelisks are charged, the player will be given bonus points, full armour, max ammo and full power drops.</li>

            <p class="step-group-title">Boss Fight</p>
            <p class="step-group-title">Warning: Point of No Return. Once you interact with the portal, you will be put into the Boss Fight.</p>
            <li>The Decimator Shield is highly recommended to counter Kortifex's attack during the Boss Fight.</li>
            <li>Interact with the Portal near Pack-a-Punch to enter the Boss Fight.</li>
            <li>The Boss Fight has three phases: </li>
            <p class="step-group-title">Phase 1</p>
            <li>During the first phase, the player needs to shoot Kortifex's upper eye while evading from danger. Once Kortifex's eye is destroyed, the second phase will begin, and the player will be teleported to another area.</li>
            <p class="step-group-title">Phase 2</p>
            <li>Shoot the <a href="pictures/main_ee/darkaethercrystals.png">Dark Aether crystals</a> found on the ground around the area to spawn a <a href="pictures/main_ee/crystalshard.png">red Crystal Shard</a>.</li>
            <li>Throw the red Crystal Shards into the <a href="pictures/main_ee/purplepods.png">Purple Pods</a> to convert them to <a href="pictures/main_ee/bluecrystalshard.png">blue Corrupted Crystal Shard</a>.</li>
            <li>Throw the blue shard at one of the <a href="pictures/main_ee/pillarinsky.png">floating pillars in the sky</a>. The pillar will crash into the Construct disabling Kortifex's shield bubble, allowing the player to shoot his two other eyes.</li>
            <li>Once another one of Kortifex's eyes is destroyed, the third phase will begin and the player will be teleported to another area.</li>
            <p class="step-group-title">Phase 3</p>
            <li>The third phase is identical to the second phase, except this time Kortifex can heal himself.</li>
            <li>To stop Kortifex from healing, hit him with the floating pillars in the sky.</li>
            <li>Once the final eye is destroyed, a short conversation will play and the players will be awarded with the following rewards: the calling card "There Archon Be Only One" as well as the Wunderwaffe DG-2, five Sacrificial Hearts, and one tier upgrade for the perks the player had during the fight.</li>
