    <h2>Chrysalax Savager</h2>
    <p>The Chrysalax is available through the mystery box, completion of challenges, and via the following quest: <br>The Chrysalax can simply be Pack-A-Punched and does not require an Easter Egg to do so.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Unlock Pack-a-Punch.</li>
      <li>Interact with the <a href="pictures/quest/button.png">Button on the Observation Tower</a>.</li>
      <li>To make the Chrysalax, the player needs to collect three items, Tempered Crystal Heart, Energetic Geode and Polymorphic Crystal Core. Each part can be obtained at anytime in any order.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Tempered Crystal Heart</p>
      <li>Kill a Tormentor with the Flamethrower Scorestreak.</li>
      <li>When killed, the Tormentor will drop the <a href="pictures/chrysalax/heart.png">Tempered Crystal Heart</a>.</li>

      <li>When hit by the lightning or exploded, the crystal will be turned into an <a href="pictures/chrysalax/geode.png">Energetic Geode</a>.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Polymorphic Crystal Core</p>
      <li>Wait two rounds after pressing the <a href="pictures/quest/button.png" >Button on the Observation Tower</a>.</li>
      <li>Navigate to <a href="pictures/chrysalax/jimsdonuts.png">Jim's Donuts on Main Street</a>.</li>
      <li>Stand near the <a href="pictures/chrysalax/jimsdonuts_crystal.png">Crystal</a> behind the counter. This will spawn three waves of enemies.</li>
      <li>The three waves consist of 5 Plaguehounds, three Tempests and finally two Mimics. Once the three waves have been killed, the Crystal become available for pickup.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Crafting the Chrysalax</p>
      <li>Navigate to the <a href="pictures/chrysalax/particleaccelerator.png">Particle Accelerator</a> and place the Crystals in to <a href="pictures/chrysalax/tub.png">The Tub</a>.</li>
      <li>Get 10 Melee Kills beside the Tub.</li>

      <li>Similar to the Chrysalax, the player needs to collect three items to start the boss fight. The steps can be completed at anytime in any order.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Obtain and Fill the Fuel Tank</p>
      <li>Navigate to Fuel Processing, each player must simultaneously interact with the <a href="pictures/quest/processingtanks.png">Processing Tanks</a> to activate them. The number of Processing Tanks that need to be activated depends on the number of players in the game.</li>
      <li>Once the Tanks have been activated, the area will be locked down and enemies will start to spawn. The player(s) must survive until the lockdown ends and the <a href="pictures/quest/fueltank.png">Fuel Tank</a> falls to the floor.</li>
      <li>Pickup the Fuel Tank.</li>
      <li>Obtain the <a href="#chrysalax" class="link-to-page">Chrysalax</a>.</li>
      <li>Navigate to three large Aetherium Crystals (the locations below) and shoot the three orbs flying around the crystal (The best weapon for this is the Chrysalax's Gun Form because of its high damage). Once the orbs are destroyed, melee the Large Crystal with the Chrysalax to destroy it.</li>
      <li>Once destroyed, the Crystal will break into a <a href="pictures/quest/crystalshard.png">Crystal Shard</a>. After picking up the Crystal Shard, an Abomination will spawn nearby.</li>
      <li>Throw the Shard into the Abomination's mouth. After it swallows the Crystal, and its <a href="pictures/quest/redtailabomination.png">tail becomes red</a>, kill it and collect the <a href="pictures/quest/redcrystalshard.png">Catalyzed Crystal Shard</a> that it drops.</li>

      <li>Obtain a Pack-a-Punched Weapon with Dead Wire</li>
      <li>Obtain from Zombie Drops or <a href="pictures/quest/arcadetoken_buy.png">Buy</a> an Arcade Token</li>
      <li>Navigate to the <a href="pictures/quest/arcade.png">Arcade</a> and electrocute a Zombie near the <a href="pictures/quest/grandprixmachine.png">Grand Prix Arcade Machine</a>.</li>
      <li>Interact with the Arcade Machine to spawn an ARC-XD. Drive the ARC-XD to the <a href="pictures/quest/tvstore.png">TV Store</a> and locate the <a href="pictures/quest/vent.png">Loosened Vent</a> behind the counter.</li>
      <li>Destroy the vent cover with the passive pulses from the ARC-XD and drive through the vent. Position the ARC-XD between the <a href="pictures/quest/shelfandwall.png">shelf and wall</a> and detonate the ARC-XD.</li>
      <li>Go to the TV Store and pick up the <a href="pictures/quest/monitoringdevice.png">Monitoring Device</a> from the shelf.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Obtain the Housing Unit</p>
      <li>Wait for an Abomination to spawn.</li>

      <p class="step-group-title">Assemble and Escort the Aetherium Neutralizer</p>
      <li>Navigate to the Main Street and craft the Aetherium Neutralizer at the <a href="pictures/quest/workbench.png">workbench</a> by Tombstone.</li>
      <p class="step-group-title">Warning: Point of No Return. Once you activate the Neutralizer, you will be put into the Boss Fight. There will be an opportunity to Buy Perks, Armour, Scorestreaks and Use PAP, but you can no longer explore the map or gain points.</p>
      <li>Interact with the Neutralizer to begin escorting it. The Neutralizer requires <a href="pictures/quest/orangeshard_escort_alt.png">Catalyzed Crystal Shards</a> for fuel. The Shards can be collected by destroying <a href="pictures/quest/orangedarkaethercrystal.png">Orange Dark Aether Crystals</a>.</li>
      <li>Escort the Neutralizer, refuelling when requested, till you reach the Containment Door.</li>
      <p class="step-group-title">Warning: This is your last opportunity to Buy Perks, Armour, Scorestreaks and Use PAP. You cannot come back here during the boss fight.</p>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <p class="step-group-title">Forsaken Boss Fight: </p>
      <li>To simplify the explanation of this boss fight, I'm going to split this into two parts: How to Attack and How The Forsaken Attacks.</li>
      <li>How to Attack:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>The Forsaken has four armoured spots that need to be broken to be able to damage him. These spots can only be broken in the following order:<br>Left Shoulder/Right Shoulder, Left Shoulder/Right Shoulder, Lower Torso and Top of Head.</li>
        <li>Once one of these spots has been broken, a weak spot will be revealed. The player needs to shoot these weak spots with either of the two laser cannons.</li>
        <li>To charge the cannons, you must charge Sam by killing zombies in the circle below her.</li>
        <li>Once she is charged, she will activate one of the cannons allowing you to shoot the Forsaken.</li>
        <li><i>Repeat Steps 1-4 for each of the four armoured/weak spots.</i></li>
      </ol>
      <li> How The Forsaken Attacks: </li>
      <ol>
        <li>The Forsaken has four attacks: Lightning Slam, Blizzard, Energy Ball and Laser Eyes</li>
        <li>Lightning Slam: While he still has arms, The Forsaken can raise one of his arms and slam it on the ground which will produce electric shockwaves. Any players caught under the hand will be instantly downed. The shockwave ripples out from the Hand, doing less and less damage the further from the hand they get.</li>
        <li>Blizzard: If the players destroy the right arm first, the Forsaken will start attacking with the Blizzard attack. The Forsaken will raise his damaged arm and spawn two areas of frost that slow players within it.</li>
        <li>Energy Ball: If the players destroy the left arm first, the Forsaken will start attacking with the Energy Ball attack. The Forsaken will raise his damaged arm and produce tracking energy orbs that will do damage to any player in its radius.</li>
        <li>Once both arms are destroyed, the Forsaken will no longer use his Lightning Slam attack, however, he will still use the Energy Ball and Blizzard Attacks.</li>
        <li>Once both arms are destroyed, the Forsaken will shoot laser out of his eyes that tracks a player, doing damage if they're in the area.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Once the last weak spot has been shot and the health bar hits 0 and disappears, a narrative sequence will begin and the Forsaken will slowly damage all players till they go down. The players can down themselves (via explosives or letting the Zombies down them) before being killed by the Forsaken to skip some voicelines.</li>
      <li>Once all players are downed and the voicelines are finished, a cutscene will start. After it is finished, an in-game cutscene will start followed by the final cutscene.</li>
