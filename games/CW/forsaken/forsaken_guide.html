    <ul>
      <p class="step-group-title" id="main_ee_step6">Forsaken Boss Fight</p>
      <li>To simplify the explanation of this boss fight, I'm going to split this into two parts: How to Attack and How The Forsaken Attacks.</li>
      <li>How to Attack:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>The Forsaken has four armoured spots that need to be broken to be able to damage him. These spots can only be broken in the following order:<br>Left Shoulder/Right Shoulder, Left Shoulder/Right Shoulder, Lower Torso and Top of Head.</li>
        <li>Once one of these spots has been broken, a weak spot will be revealed. The player needs to shoot these weak spots with either of the two laser cannons.</li>
        <li>To charge the cannons, you must charge Sam by killing zombies in the circle below her.</li>
        <li>Once she is charged, she will activate one of the cannons allowing you to shoot the Forsaken.</li>
        <li><i>Repeat Steps 1-4 for each of the four armoured/weak spots.</i></li>
      </ol>
      <li> How The Forsaken Attacks: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The Forsaken has four attacks: Lightning Slam, Blizzard, Energy Ball and Laser Eyes</li>
        <li>Lightning Slam: While he still has arms, The Forsaken can raise one of his arms and slam it on the ground which will produce electric shockwaves. Any players caught under the hand will be instantly downed. The shockwave ripples out from the Hand, doing less and less damage the further from the hand they get.</li>
        <li>Blizzard: If the players destroy the right arm first, the Forsaken will start attacking with the Blizzard attack. The Forsaken will raise his damaged arm and spawn two areas of frost that slow players within it.</li>
        <li>Energy Ball: If the players destroy the left arm first, the Forsaken will start attacking with the Energy Ball attack. The Forsaken will raise his damaged arm and produce tracking energy orbs that will do damage to any player in its radius.</li>
        <li>Once both arms are destroyed, the Forsaken will no longer use his Lightning Slam attack, however, he will still use the Energy Ball and Blizzard Attacks.</li>
        <li>Once both arms are destroyed, the Forsaken will shoot laser out of his eyes that tracks a player, doing damage if they're in the area.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Once the last weak spot has been shot, the health bar hits 0 and disappears, a narrative sequence will begin and the Forsaken will slowly damage all players till they go down. The players can down themselves (via explosives or letting the Zombies down them) before being killed by the Forsaken to skip some voicelines.</li>
      <li>Once all players are downed and the voicelines are finished, a cutscene will start. After it is finished, an in-game cutscene will start followed by the final cutscene.</li>
