                    <li>To tell the coins apart, you can look at the text that appears when looking at a coin, a real one will say "Hold Interact to Obtain Charon's Obol" and a false one will say "Hold Interact to Extinguish the False Obol".</li>
                    <li>There is no penalty for picking up a False Obol, it is actually recommended so they no longer glow, making it easier to find other coins.</li>

            <li>To upgrade any of the Hands to Exalted, you must do the following for each Hand.

            <li>Once all four shrines are charged, interact with the Pack-a-Punch while holding the Hand you'd like to upgrade to be teleported to the Redeemed upgrade arena. The difference with this arena, compared to the Redeemed arena, is that the Hand does not have unlimited ammo and stronger enemies (like Blightfathers, Gegenees, etc) will spawn instead of regular Zombies.</li>
            <li>Once complete, you will be rewarded with the Exalted Version of the Hand you completed the trial with. To obtain the other Exalted Hands, complete the previous step again with the other Hands.</li>
